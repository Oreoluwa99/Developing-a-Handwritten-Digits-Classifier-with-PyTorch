# Developing-a-Handwritten-Digits-Classifier-with-PyTorch
This project focuses on developing a neural network model to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to create an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system capable of recognizing and classifying handwritten characters. The project involves preprocessing the dataset, building a neural network using PyTorch, and training and tuning the model to achieve high accuracy.
